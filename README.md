Genomic neighbour typing for lineage and genotype inference of bacterial pathogens

## Overview

**`v0.6.0`**

`Sketchy` is a lineage calling and genotyping tool based on the heuristic principle of genomic neighbor typing developed by [Karel BÅ™inda and colleagues (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/403204v2). It queries species-wide ('hypothesis-agnostic') reference sketches using MinHash and infers associated genotypes based on the closest match, including multi-locus sequence types, susceptibility profiles, virulence factors or other genome-associated features provided by the user. Unlike the original implementation in [`RASE`](https://github.com/c2-d2/rase-pipeline), `Sketchy` does not use phylogenetic trees which has some downsides, e.g. for sublineage genotype predictions (see below). 

See the [latest docs](https://esteinig.github.io/sketchy) for install, usage and database building.

## Strengths and limitations

Please see the preprint for detailed limitations of `Sketchy`. 

* `Sketchy` performs best on lineage predictions and lineage-distributed genotypes from few reads
* Reference sketches and genotype indices can be constructed easily from large genome collections

However:

* Because of the approximate matching approach using MinHash, sub-lineage genotype resolution is not as good as `RASE`, which uses phylogenetic trees (and may be preferred for inference of clade-specific traits)
* `Sketchy` genotype inference may be difficult for species with high rates of homologous recombination - it is advised to run simulations and validations for species we have not provided reference sketches for

## Release v0.6.0 

Target: 14 February 2022

* upload of species reference sketches we have constructed for users
* utility tools to build sketches from the ENA data by [Grace Blackwell et al.](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001421)
* default k-mer sizes for the databases are currently very small (k = 16), needs optimisation
