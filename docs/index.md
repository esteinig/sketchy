`Sketchy` is a lineage calling and genotyping tool based on the heuristic principle of genomic neighbor typing developed by [Karel BÅ™inda and colleagues (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/403204v2). It queries species-wide ('hypothesis-agnostic') reference sketches using MinHash and infers associated genotypes based on the closest match, including multi-locus sequence types, susceptibility profiles, virulence factors or other genome-associated features provided by the user. Unlike the original implementation, `Sketchy` does not use phylogenetic trees (which has some downsides) and is easier to modify for users, for example to construct reference sketches for local genome collections, or species not implemented in the current release.

## Example

For demonstration we will build a high-resolution reference sketch of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* isolates from the ENA reference assembly collection. For a full guide on how to simulate test data sets with `Sketchy` see the [`Walkthrough`]('walkthrough/building_reference_sketches.md) section.
