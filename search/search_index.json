Sketchy queries species-wide (hypothesis-agnostic) reference sketches using MinHash methods to infer genotypes based on the closest reference match. Reference databases and genotypes, such has multi-locus sequence types, susceptibility profiles, or virulence factors, are configurable by users.

Subcommands \u00b6 Show subcommands available in the Rust client. $ sketchy --help Show subcommands available in the Python client. $ sketchy-utils --help Predictions \u00b6 Sketchy predicts the genotype of the genome with the highest shared hashes in the reference sketch. Two modes are available: Offline (read sets) : k-mers are hashed and shared hashes computed from a set of reads. Output are the --top genome matches and their genotypes. Online (streaming) : k-mers are hashed for each incoming read, the sum of shared hashes for each genome in the reference sketch is updated and the --top genome matches and their genotypes based on the sorted sum of shared hashes at the current read are printed. Sum of shared hashes based on streaming are slightly less informative than shared hashes based on read sets. Streaming requires less memory, but can be slow for large read sets, especially when deploying large reference sketches. Predictions require the input sequences ( -i ), a reference sketch ( -r ) and a matching genotype file ( -g ) as described below ( Genotype files ).
